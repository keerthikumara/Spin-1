1. Notebook containing the perturbed Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) AKLT ground state circuits and additional circuits required to compute the full ternary probability vector.
2. A notebook with VQE using PBC ansatz to capture perturbed ground states is also attached.
3. Notebook containing phase shift experiments
4. Notebook containing Berry phase estimation from the hardware data.

   The hardware results data have all been printed in the cells found in these notebooks.
